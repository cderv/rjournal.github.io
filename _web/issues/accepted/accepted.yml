  abstract: ' Abstract The StratigrapheR package proposes new concepts for the generation
    of lithological logs,           or lithologs, in R. The generation of lithologs
    in a scripting environment opens new opportunities           for the processing
    and analysis of stratified geological data. Among the new concepts presented:           new
    plotting and data processing methodologies, new general R functions, and computer-oriented           data
    conventions are provided. The package structure allows for these new concepts
    to be further           improved, which can be done independently by any R user.
    The current limitations of the package are           highlighted, along with the
    limitations in R for geological data processing, to help identify the best           paths
    for improvements.  '

    A Unifying Framework for Parallel and Distributed Processing
              in R using Futures
  author: Henrik Bengtsson
  bibauthor: Henrik Bengtsson
  abstract: ' Abstract A future is a programming construct designed for concurrent
    and asynchronous evaluation           of code, making it particularly useful for
    parallel processing. The future package implements the           Future API for
    programming with futures in R. This minimal API provides sufficient constructs
    for           implementing parallel versions of well-established, high-level map-reduce
    APIs. The future ecosystem           supports exception handling, output and condition
    relaying, parallel random number generation, and           automatic identification
    of globals lowering the threshold to parallelize code. The Future API bridges           parallel
    frontends with parallel backends following the philosophy that end-users are the
    ones who           choose the parallel backend while the developer focuses on
    what to parallelize. A variety of backends           exist and third-party contributions
    meeting the specifications, which ensure that the same code works           on
    all backends, are automatically supported. The future framework solves several
    problems not           addressed by other parallel frameworks in R.  '

  abstract: ' Abstract During the building of a genome-scale metabolic model, there
    are several dead-end metabo          lites and substrates which cannot be imported,
    produced nor used by any reaction incorporated in           the network. The presence
    of these dead-end metabolites can block out the net flux of the objective           function
    when it is evaluated through Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and when it is not blocked,
    bias           in the biological conclusions increase. In this aspect, the refinement
    to restore the connectivity of           the network can be carried out manually
    or using computational algorithms. The g2f package was           designed as a
    tool to find the gaps from dead-end metabolites and fill them from the stoichiometric           reactions
    of a reference, filtering candidate reactions using a weighting function. Additionally,
    this           algorithm allows to download all the set of gene-associated stoichiometric
    reactions for a specific           organism from the KEGG database. Our package
    is compatible with both 4.0.0 and 3.6.0 R versions.  '

  title: A New Versatile Discrete Distribution
  bibtitle: A New Versatile Discrete Distribution
  author: Rolf Turner
  bibauthor: Rolf Turner
  abstract: ' Abstract This paper introduces a new flexible distribution for discrete
    data. Approximate moment           estimators of the parameters of the distribution,
    to be used as starting values for numerical opti          mization procedures,
    are discussed. “Exact” moment estimation, effected via a numerical procedure,           and
    maximum likelihood estimation, are considered. The quality of the results produced
    by these           estimators is assessed via simulation experiments. Several
    examples are given of fitting instances of           the new distribution to real
    and simulated data. It is noted that the new distribution is a member           of
    the exponential family. Expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood
    of the new           distribution are derived. The former facilitates the numerical
    maximization of the likelihood with           optim(); the latter provides means
    of calculating or estimating the covariance matrix of of the parame          ter
    estimates. A discrepancy between estimates of the covariance matrix obtained by
    inverting the           Hessian and those obtained by Monte Carlo methods is discussed.  '

  title: 'Estimating Social Influence Effects in Networks Using A Latent Space Adjusted

    Estimating Social Influence Effects in Networks Using A
              Latent Space Adjusted Approach in R
  author: Ran Xu
  bibauthor: Ran Xu
  abstract: ' Abstract Social influence effects have been extensively studied in various
    empirical network research.           However, many challenges remain in estimating
    social influence effects in networks, as influence           effects are often
    entangled with other factors, such as homophily in the selection process and the           common
    social-environmental factors that individuals are embedded in. Methods currently
    available           either do not solve these problems or require stringent assumptions.
    Recent works by Xu (2018) and           others have shown that a latent-space
    adjusted approach based on the latent space model has the           potential
    to disentangle the influence effects from other processes, and the simulation
    evidence has           shown that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art
    approaches in terms of recovering the           true social influence effect when
    there is an unobserved trait co-determining influence and selection.           In
    this paper I will further illustrate how the latent-space adjusted approach can
    account for bias in           the estimation of social influence effects, and
    how this approach can be easily implemented in R.  '

  bibauthor: Gustavo Soutinho and Marta Sestelo and Luís Meira-Machado
  abstract: ' Abstract Multi-state models are a useful way of describing a process
    in which an individual moves           through a number of finite states in continuous
    time. The illness-death model plays a central role in           the theory and
    practice of these models, describing the dynamics of healthy subjects who may
    move           to an intermediate "diseased" state before entering into a terminal
    absorbing state. In these models one           important goal is the modeling
    of transition rates which is usually done by studying the relationship           between
    covariates and disease evolution. However, biomedical researchers are also interested
    in           reporting other interpretable results in a simple and summarized
    manner. These include estimates           of predictive probabilities, such as
    the transition probabilities, occupation probabilities, cumulative           incidence
    functions and the sojourn time distributions. The development of survidm package
    has           been motivated by recent contributions that provides answers to
    all these topics. Illustration of the           software usage is included using
    real data.  '

  abstract: ' Abstract Multidimensional scaling (MDS), hierarchical cluster analysis
    (HCA) and discriminant           analysis (DA) are classical techniques which
    deal with data made of n individuals and p variables.           When the individuals
    are divided into T groups, the R package dad associates with each group a           multivariate
    probability density function and then carries out these techniques on the densities
    which           are estimated by the data under consideration. These techniques
    are based on distance measures           between densities: chi-square, Hellinger,
    Jeffreys, Jensen-Shannon and L p for discrete densities,           Hellinger ,
    Jeffreys, L2 and 2-Wasserstein for Gaussian densities, and L2 for numeric non
    Gaussian           densities estimated by the Gaussian kernel method. Practical
    methods help the user to give meaning           to the outputs in the context
    of MDS and HCA, and to look for an optimal prediction in the context of           DA
    based on the one-leave-out misclassification ratio. Some functions for data management
    or basic           statistics calculations on groups are annexed.  '

  abstract: ' Abstract High-dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data sets emerge frequently
    in many biomedical           applications. The direction-projection-permutation
    (DiProPerm) test is a two-sample hypothesis test           for comparing two high-dimensional
    distributions. The DiProPerm test is exact, i.e., the type I error           is
    guaranteed to be controlled at the nominal level for any sample size, and thus
    is applicable in           the HDLSS setting. This paper discusses the key components

  abstract: ' Abstract Balancing the distributions of the confounders across the exposure
    levels in an observational           study through matching or weighting is an
    accepted method to control for confounding due to these           variables when
    estimating the association between an exposure and outcome and to reduce the degree           of
    dependence on certain modeling assumptions. Despite the increasing popularity
    in practice, these           procedures cannot be immediately applied to datasets
    with missing values. Multiple imputation of           the missing data is a popular
    approach to account for missing values while preserving the number of           units
    in the dataset and accounting for the uncertainty in the missing values. However,
    to the best           of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive matching and
    weighting software that can be easily           implemented with multiply imputed
    datasets. In this paper, we review this problem and suggest a           framework
    to map out the matching and weighting multiply imputed datasets to 5 actions as
    well as           the best practices to assess balance in these datasets after
    matching and weighting. We also illustrate           these approaches using a

    CompModels: A Suite of Computer Model Test Functions for

  author: Tony Pourmohamad
  bibauthor: Tony Pourmohamad
  abstract: ' Abstract The CompModels package for R provides a suite of computer model
    test functions that           can be used for computer model prediction/emulation,
    uncertainty quantification, and calibration.           Moreover, the CompModels
    package is especially well suited for the sequential optimization of           computer
    models. The package is a mix of real-world physics problems, known mathematical           functions,
    and black-box functions that have been converted into computer models with the
    goal of           Bayesian (i.e., sequential) optimization in mind. Likewise,
    the package contains computer models           that represent either the constrained
    or unconstrained optimization case, each with varying levels of           difficulty.
    In this paper, we illustrate the use of the package with both real-world examples
    and black          box functions by solving constrained optimization problems
    via Bayesian optimization. Ultimately, the           package is shown to provide
    users with a source of computer model test functions that are reproducible,           shareable,
    and that can be used for benchmarking of novel optimization methods.  '

  abstract: ' Abstract In many contexts, missing data and disclosure control are ubiquitous
    and challenging           issues. In particular at statistical agencies, the respondent-level
    data they collect from surveys and           censuses can suffer from high rates
    of missingness. Furthermore, agencies are obliged to protect           respondents’
    privacy when publishing the collected data for public use. The NPBayesImputeCat
    R           package, introduced in this paper, provides routines to i) create
    multiple imputations for missing data,           and ii) create synthetic data
    for statistical disclosure control, for multivariate categorical data, with           or
    without structural zeros. We describe the Dirichlet process mixture of products
    of multinomial           distributions model used in the package, and illustrate
    various uses of the package using data samples           from the American Community
    Survey (ACS). We also compare results of the missing data imputation           to
    the mice R package and those of the synthetic data generation to the synthpop
    R package.  '

  abstract: ' Abstract This paper presents a graphical user interface (GUI) to carry
    out a Bayesian regression           analysis in a very friendly environment without
    any programming skills (drag and drop). This paper           is designed for teaching
    and applied purposes at an introductory level. Our GUI is based on an           interactive
    web application using shiny, and libraries from R. We carry out some applications
    to           highlight the potential of our GUI for applied researchers and practitioners.
    In addition, the Help           option in the main tap panel has an extended version
    of this paper, where we present the basic theory           underlying all regression
    models that we developed in our GUI, and more applications associated           with
    each model.  '

  abstract: ' Abstract Left censoring can occur with relative frequency when analysing
    recurrent events in epi          demiological studies, especially observational
    ones. Concretely, the inclusion of individuals that           were already at
    risk before the effective initiation in a cohort study, may cause the unawareness
    of           prior episodes that have already been experienced, and this will
    easily lead to biased and inefficient           estimates. The miRecSurv package
    is based on the use of models with specific baseline hazard, with           multiple
    imputation of the number of prior episodes when unknown by means of the COMPoisson           distribution,
    a very flexible count distribution that can handle over-, suband equidispersion,
    with a           stratified model depending on whether the individual had or had
    not previously been at risk, and the           use of a frailty term. The usage
    of the package is illustrated by means of a real data example based on           a
    occupational cohort study and a simulation study.  '

  abstract: ' Abstract This article illustrates the use of the bcmixed package and
    focuses on the two main functions:           bcmarg and bcmmrm. The bcmarg function
    provides inference results for a marginal model of a mixed ef          fect model
    using the Box–Cox transformation. The bcmmrm function provides model median inferences           based
    on the mixed effect models for repeated measures analysis using the Box–Cox transformation
    for           longitudinal randomized clinical trials. Using the bcmmrm function,
    analysis results with high power           and high interpretability for treatment
    effects can be obtained for longitudinal randomized clinical           trials
    with skewed outcomes. Further, the bcmixed package provides summarizing and visualization           tools,
    which would be helpful to write clinical trial reports.  '

    spfilteR: An R Package for Semiparametric Spatial Filtering
              with Eigenvectors in (Generalized) Linear Models
  author: Sebastian Juhl
  bibauthor: Sebastian Juhl
  abstract: ' Abstract Eigenvector-based spatial filtering constitutes a highly flexible
    semiparametric approach           to account for spatial autocorrelation in a
    regression framework. It combines judiciously selected           eigenvectors
    from a transformed connectivity matrix to construct a synthetic spatial filter
    and remove           spatial patterns from model residuals. This article introduces
    the spfilteR package that provides           several useful and flexible tools
    to estimate spatially filtered linear and generalized linear models in           R.
    While the package features functions to identify relevant eigenvectors based on
    different selection           criteria in an unsupervised fashion, it also helps
    users to perform supervised spatial filtering and to           select eigenvectors
    based on alternative user-defined criteria. After a brief discussion of the eigenvector          based
    spatial filtering approach, this article presents the main functions of the package
    and illustrates           their usage. A comparison to alternative implementations
    in other R packages highlights the added           value of the spfilteR package.  '

  abstract: ' Abstract We describe the vote package in R, which implements the plurality
    (or first-past-the-post),           two-round runoff, score, approval and single
    transferable vote (STV) electoral systems, as well as           methods for selecting
    the Condorcet winner and loser. We emphasize the STV system, which we have           found
    to work well in practice for multi-winner elections with small electorates, such
    as committee           and council elections, and the selection of multiple job
    candidates. For single-winner elections, the           STV is also called instant
    runoff voting (IRV), ranked choice voting (RCV), or the alternative vote (AV)           system.
    The package also implements the STV system with equal preferences, for the first
    time in a           software package, to our knowledge. It also implements a new
    variant of STV, in which a minimum           number of candidates from a specified
    group are required to be elected. We illustrate the package with           several
    real examples.  '
